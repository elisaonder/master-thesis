Political polarization has become a central concern in Portugal as new parties reshape the parliamentary landscape. This thesis examines how political polarization has evolved since 2011 and its association with the rise of the radical-right party Chega. The analysis is based on a combination of the ideological scores derived from electoral program, an ensemble of Large Language Models classifying interventions in parliament as polarized or non-polarized, and a nonverbal reaction network built from shouts, applause and laughter.
The results show widening ideological distances and an increase in affective polarization after 2021, with Chega acting both as an authoritarian-right outlier and the main target of parliamentary hostility.
