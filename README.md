This repository contains the work for a Master’s thesis investigating political polarization in Portugal, with a particular focus on the rise of Chega. Using text mining and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the project analyzes the language used in Portuguese parliamentary debates (2015–2022) to quantify ideological divergence over time.
